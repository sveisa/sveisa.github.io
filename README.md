Notes for updating content:

to update content, open the JSON folder, click on the sources.json file, and edit the file. 
Here you can change the text values, reference images, videos, and audio files that have been uploaded to the repo.

If you want to make a post that requires video or audio, upload the video/audio/pdf first.
videos, audios, and pdfs go into "otherContent" folder
images go into "images" folder

to edit text, just write the text into the JSON.

each page will have a formatting comment, just follow that and you shouldnt run into any errors.
